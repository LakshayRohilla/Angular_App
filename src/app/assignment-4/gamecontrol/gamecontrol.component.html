          Bind it!
          1. Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even
          2. The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
          3. When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref =
          setinterval()
          4. The event should be listenable from outside the component
          5. When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearlnterval(ref))
          6. A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the
          Even Component (on even numbers)
          7. Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
          8. Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components
